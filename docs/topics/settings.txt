.. setting:: ADMINS

ADMINS
------

Default: ``()`` (Empty tuple)

A tuple that lists people who get code error notifications. When
``DEBUG=False`` and a view raises an exception, Django will email these people
with the full exception information. Each member of the tuple should be a tuple
of (Full name, email address). Example::

    (('John', 'john@example.com'), ('Mary', 'mary@example.com'))

Note that Django will email *all* of these people whenever an error happens.
See :doc:`/howto/virtualenv` for more information.
